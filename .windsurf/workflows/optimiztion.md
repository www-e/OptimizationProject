1.  **Prioritize User Experience (UX):** The UI must be intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing.
2.  **Modularity is Key:** Design Python backend and JS frontend with reusable, independent modules/components.
3.  **Clear API Contract:** The API between backend and frontend must be well-defined and strictly adhered to.
4.  **State Management Excellence (Frontend):** Implement a robust and predictable state management solution.
5.  **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors on both backend (API responses) and frontend (UI feedback).
6.  **Asynchronous Operations (Frontend):** All API calls must be asynchronous to prevent UI blocking.
7.  **Performance Matters:** Optimize for speed, especially in backend computations and frontend rendering.
8.  **Readability and Maintainability:** Write clean, well-commented code (Python PEP 8, consistent JS style).
9.  **Configuration over Hardcoding:** Make parameters (optimizer, task, UI elements) configurable where possible.
10. **Consistent Design Language:** Adhere strictly to the specified orange-themed, futuristic aesthetic.
11. **Responsive Design (Frontend):** Ensure the application adapts reasonably to different screen sizes.
12. **Dynamic Data Loading (Frontend):** Populate UI elements (dropdowns, forms) based on data fetched from the API.
13. **Interactive Visualizations:** Charts and graphs should offer tooltips, interactivity, and customization.
14. **Informative Feedback (Frontend):** Provide clear status updates, loading indicators, and success/error messages.
15. **Security Awareness (Backend):** While not a primary focus, avoid obvious security flaws in API design (e.g., input validation).
16. **Testability:** Structure code to be easily testable (unit tests for backend logic are highly encouraged).
17. **Backend First, Then Frontend:** Ensure backend logic and API are solid before fully building out the frontend.
18. **No Redundant Data Entry:** Maximize reuse of selections and data across the application.
19. **Focus on Core Functionality First:** Deliver the specified features before adding bells and whistles beyond the prompt.
20. **Iterative Refinement is Expected:** The first pass might not be perfect; be prepared to refine based on this detailed specification.
