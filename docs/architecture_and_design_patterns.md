# Architectural and Design Patterns

## Overall Architecture

The Neural Network Optimization project follows a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The system is organized into the following key components:

### 1. Web Application Layer
- **Flask Web Framework**: Provides the web interface for users to interact with the optimization algorithms
- **Templates**: HTML templates with Jinja2 templating for dynamic content
- **Static Resources**: CSS, JavaScript, and other assets for the frontend
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for configuration management and experiment execution

### 2. Algorithm Layer
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Implementation of various optimization algorithms (GA, PSO)
- **Algorithm Configuration**: Parameter management for the optimization algorithms
- **Algorithm Execution**: Logic for running optimization processes

### 3. Experiment Layer
- **Experiment Types**: Different experiment implementations (weight optimization, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning)
- **Experiment Configuration**: Settings for controlling experiment execution
- **Results Management**: Storage and retrieval of experiment results

### 4. Data Layer
- **Data Loading**: Utilities for loading and preprocessing datasets
- **Data Transformation**: Scaling, normalization, and other data transformations
- **Data Storage**: Storage of datasets, configurations, and results

### 5. Utility Layer
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing results and algorithm performance
- **Configuration Management**: Utilities for managing configuration parameters
- **Logging**: Logging facilities for tracking execution and debugging

## Design Patterns

The project implements several design patterns to promote maintainability, extensibility, and code reuse:

### 1. Factory Pattern
- **Implementation**: The system uses factory methods to create appropriate algorithm instances based on configuration
- **Example**: Creating GA or PSO algorithm instances based on user selection
- **Benefits**: Encapsulates object creation logic, allows for future algorithm additions without modifying client code

### 2. Strategy Pattern
- **Implementation**: Different optimization algorithms implement a common interface
- **Example**: GA and PSO algorithms can be used interchangeably in experiments
- **Benefits**: Algorithms can be swapped at runtime, new algorithms can be added without changing client code

### 3. Observer Pattern
- **Implementation**: Used for monitoring algorithm progress and updating the UI
- **Example**: Progress bars and real-time updates during algorithm execution
- **Benefits**: Decouples algorithm execution from progress reporting

### 4. Singleton Pattern
- **Implementation**: Used for configuration management to ensure a single source of truth
- **Example**: ConfigManager class for managing configuration parameters
- **Benefits**: Centralizes configuration management, prevents duplicate instances

### 5. Template Method Pattern
- **Implementation**: Base experiment classes define the skeleton of the experiment process
- **Example**: BaseExperiment class with methods that subclasses override
- **Benefits**: Reuses common code while allowing specific steps to be customized

### 6. Adapter Pattern
- **Implementation**: Used to adapt different neural network libraries to a common interface
- **Example**: Adapting different model types to work with the optimization algorithms
- **Benefits**: Allows the system to work with different neural network implementations

### 7. Command Pattern
- **Implementation**: Used for executing experiments with different parameters
- **Example**: Experiment execution from the web interface
- **Benefits**: Encapsulates requests as objects, allows for undoing operations

## Component Interactions

The components interact through well-defined interfaces:

1. **Web Application → Algorithm Layer**: The web application configures and executes algorithms through their public interfaces
2. **Algorithm Layer → Experiment Layer**: Algorithms are used within experiments to optimize neural networks
3. **Experiment Layer → Data Layer**: Experiments load and process data from the data layer
4. **Utility Layer**: Used by all other layers for common functionality

## Extensibility Points

The architecture is designed with several extensibility points:

1. **New Optimization Algorithms**: Add new algorithm implementations by following the existing interfaces
2. **New Experiment Types**: Create new experiment classes by extending the base experiment classes
3. **New Neural Network Models**: Add support for new model types through the adapter pattern
4. **New Visualization Methods**: Add new visualization methods to the visualization utilities
5. **New Configuration Parameters**: Extend the configuration system to support new parameters

## Conclusion

The architecture and design patterns used in this project promote separation of concerns, code reuse, and extensibility. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.
