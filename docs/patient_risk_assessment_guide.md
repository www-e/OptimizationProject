# Patient Risk Assessment Guide

## Dataset and Risk Calculation

The dataset used in this project contains 40 patient records with 10 normalized biomarkers (values between 0-1) that map to real-world medical ranges. Each patient record follows clear clinical patterns, with disease risk assigned based on established risk factors.

### Biomarkers and Their Significance

| Biomarker | Normal Range | Risk Threshold | Clinical Significance |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Glucose Level | 0.3-0.6 | >0.7 | High values indicate diabetes risk |
| Blood Pressure | 0.3-0.6 | >0.75 | High values indicate hypertension |
| BMI | 0.3-0.6 | >0.67 | High values indicate obesity |
| Cholesterol | 0.3-0.6 | >0.65 | High values indicate hyperlipidemia |
| Heart Rate | 0.4-0.6 | >0.7 | High values indicate cardiac stress |
| White Blood Cells | 0.4-0.6 | >0.7 | High values indicate inflammation/infection |
| Red Blood Cells | 0.4-0.6 | <0.3 | Low values indicate anemia |
| Oxygen Saturation | 0.9-1.0 | <0.85 | Low values indicate respiratory issues |
| Creatinine Level | 0.2-0.4 | >0.5 | High values indicate kidney dysfunction |
| Albumin Level | 0.4-0.6 | <0.3 | Low values indicate liver/kidney issues |

## Risk Calculation Process

### Initial Dataset Values

The `disease_risk` column in the CSV file contains binary values (0 or 1) that serve as the ground truth for training the neural network. These values were assigned based on established medical criteria:

- **High Risk (1)**: Patients with multiple elevated risk factors, particularly:
  - Glucose > 0.7
  - Blood Pressure > 0.75
  - BMI > 0.67
  - Cholesterol > 0.65

- **Low Risk (0)**: Patients with biomarkers in normal ranges or with fewer risk factors.

### Neural Network Risk Calculation

While the dataset contains initial binary risk values, the neural network performs a more sophisticated analysis:

1. **Training Phase**: The neural network learns patterns from the labeled dataset.
2. **Prediction Phase**: For new patients, the model:
   - Processes all biomarkers
   - Identifies complex relationships between biomarkers
   - Applies adaptive weighting to different risk factors
   - Outputs a continuous risk probability (0-1)

### Risk Patterns Identified by the Neural Network

The neural network identifies several key risk patterns:

1. **Metabolic Syndrome Pattern**:
   - High glucose (>0.7)
   - High blood pressure (>0.75)
   - High BMI (>0.67)
   - High cholesterol (>0.65)
   - Expected output: High risk (>0.7)

2. **Cardiac Stress Pattern**:
   - High blood pressure (>0.75)
   - High heart rate (>0.7)
   - High cholesterol (>0.65)
   - Normal/high glucose (>0.6)
   - Expected output: Moderate to high risk (0.5-0.8)

3. **Inflammatory Response Pattern**:
   - High white blood cells (>0.7)
   - Elevated heart rate (>0.65)
   - Normal/low oxygen saturation (<0.9)
   - Expected output: Moderate risk (0.4-0.6)

4. **Renal Dysfunction Pattern**:
   - High creatinine (>0.5)
   - Low albumin (<0.4)
   - High blood pressure (>0.7)
   - Expected output: Moderate to high risk (0.5-0.7)

5. **Healthy Profile Pattern**:
   - All biomarkers in normal ranges
   - Expected output: Low risk (<0.3)

## Expected Output for Patient Categories

### High Risk Patients (Risk Probability > 0.7)

Patients with multiple elevated risk factors will receive:
- Risk class: High
- Detailed risk factors highlighting specific biomarkers
- Risk patterns identified (e.g., Metabolic Syndrome)
- Comprehensive recommendations for medical intervention

### Moderate Risk Patients (Risk Probability 0.4-0.7)

Patients with some elevated risk factors will receive:
- Risk class: Moderate
- List of concerning biomarkers
- Potential risk patterns
- Preventive recommendations and monitoring suggestions

### Low Risk Patients (Risk Probability < 0.4)

Patients with normal biomarkers will receive:
- Risk class: Low
- Confirmation of normal biomarker values
- General health maintenance recommendations

## Iteration Process

The risk assessment system undergoes multiple iterations:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Basic risk calculation based on biomarker thresholds
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of common risk patterns
3. **Probability Refinement**: Fine-tuning risk probabilities based on pattern severity
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Creating tailored medical recommendations
5. **Visualization**: Presenting risk data in an accessible format

## Validation and Accuracy

The neural network's risk assessments are validated against:
- Known medical correlations between biomarkers and disease
- The original binary risk classifications in the dataset
- Established medical risk assessment protocols

This multi-layered approach ensures that the system provides accurate, clinically relevant risk assessments that can assist healthcare providers in patient management.
